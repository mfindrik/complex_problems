# Computational complexity
This repository contains pieces of codes for solving some complex computational problems.

## Introduction

Ever since computers are invented people started using it to solve different types of problems by writing algorithms (programs)
that can efficently produce a solution for a given problem. A classical example are algorithms for sorting an array of numbers
according to their value.

Algorithms can further be analysed in terms of their performance which is essentially time (number of operations) and space they 
take to produce a solution. Most commonly the algorithms are analysed only in terms of time they take using Big-Oh notation (although 
other notations exist as well). Of course, Big-Oh notation takes into account input size to the algorithm in order to determine
number of operations necessary to produce a solution. This means sorting an array of 1000 numbers will take longer than sorting an
array of 10 numbers. Some of the most common function that are used to express number of operations of an algorithm are:
  * logn - logarithmic time 
  * n - linear time 
  * nlogn
  * n^2 - polynomial time
  * exp(n) - exponential time
