# complex_problems
This repository contains code for solving complex computational problems

Ever since computers are invented people started using it to solve different types of problems by writing algorithms (programs)
that can efficently produce a solution for a given problem. A classical example are algorithms for sorting an array of numbers
according to their value.

Algorithms can further be analysed in terms of their performance which is essentially time (number of operations) and space they 
take to produce a solution.
